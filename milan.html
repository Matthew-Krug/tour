    <p>Santa Maria delle Grazie is the church that Leonardo painted The Last Supper. There are seven chaples inside this church all painted from different artists. The church and The Last Supper has a long history. During World War II a bomb was dropped
        on the church and the building collapsed. Luckily, The Last supper was packed in sand to preserve it encase of a bombing. Visitors love to see the Last Supper because of the masterpiece it is. If you plan to visit just know that you'll only have
        15 minutes and you aren't allowed to take videos. Even taking pictures is extremely strict.</p>
